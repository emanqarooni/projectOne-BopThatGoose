  //I used the onclick event instead of addEventListener because addEventListener keeps adding new listeners every time the square is updated. That means if I donâ€™t remove them properly, a single click could trigger multiple functions and increase the score or strikes more than once. Using onclick is simpler here because it automatically overwrites the old click handler, so each square only responds once at a time.
